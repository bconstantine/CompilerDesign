## Quick Advice for NTUST Juniors looking at this repo
It's normal that this project can't be completed overnight, especially project 2 and 3 with its HUMONGOUS test cases. Be patient, and take time to do the project. Take this opportunity to test your programming logic! (After all this is the final required course before graduation). You may reference this project but for your own sake **I advised not to copy if you don't want to be flagged as plagiarism**. Good luck!
